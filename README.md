# Spiders on leiphone.com

## Backgrounds

Since my major is EE and I do power system analysis in my undergraduate study, I'm a green hand in python programming. Thus, I'm taking online courses to obtain fundemantal language syntax.

My advisor suggests I get down to do a project to improve my programming skills. This is the first project I've been assigned by my team leader during my intership here in iFlytek.

## Instructions

In this project, I utilized several modules and functions for operating web browser, seperating essential information, downloading images, saving data locally and running the project automatically in specific time point.

You can download and run the spider.py on your computer directly as long as you've installed the required modules. Remember to revise the saving path in the project to make sure you can save the record on you computer.

## Functions Implemented
