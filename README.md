## Backgrounds

This is the first project I've been assigned by my team leader during my intership here in iFlytek.

Since my major is EE and I do power system analysis, I'm new to python programming. Thus, I'm taking online courses to obtain fundemantal language syntax.

My advisor suggests I get down to do a project to improve my programming skills.

## Instructions

In this project, I utilized several modules and functions for operating web browser, seperating essential information, downloading images, saving data locally and running the project automatically in specific time point.
